# The RESTLang language

## Structure

Each file represents a single resource.
The files are structure into three sections, two of which are optional.

All of those files inherit model fields, schema fields and views from the `base.rest` file[^1]

[^1]: A way to get around this will be available soon

### Models

This section is required. It describes the database model of the resource, ie. which fields are stored into the db.

A field declaration follows the following format:

```
<type> <field name>
	<properties>
```

Where `<type>` is a <<field-types,field type>>, `<field_name>` is the field's name and `<properties>` a comma-separated list of property declarations.

A property declaration follows the following format:

```
<property> [<"with" | "from" | "as" | "is" | "a" | "="> <value>],
```

Where `<property>` is a <<field-properties,field property>>, and `<value>` the property's value.

Note that if you leave out the value, and only declare the property name, it will be as if you assigned this property the boolean `true`, ie. `generate automatically,` is the same as `generate automatically = true,`.

### Model events

You can hook into several events from the model and run python code.

The format is the following:

```py
@<event>
	<python code>
```

Where `<event>` is one of:

[horizontal]
updated :: When the model gets updated
created :: When the model is created
deleted :: When the model gets deleted

You can run the same code for multiple events, by stacking them:

```py
@updated
@created
	# run some code
```

Similarily to <<Code in views,views>>, this code will receive several commodity variables prefixed by `$`.

$new ::
	The new object that will be inserted in place of the current one.
	For the `created` or `deleted` events, this is the same as $current but is the value that will be used  when calling `super`.
$current ::
	The current object, before any updating applied. For `created`, this is the object after its creation.
$now ::
	Shortcut for `datetime.datetime.now`.

#### Imports

See <<Code in views>>, the same modules are imported.

### Computed properties
If you put parentheses after the field name, its defined with a function and the `@property` decorator is added (except for `pass:[__str__]`).

.Example
```python
String __str__()
	return f"{$fields.subject}: {$fields.name or '<Untitled>'}"
```

The `$fields` variable contains an object whose properties are the fields' values.

## Schemas

Schemas represent differences between the model the API shows and receives data from, and the model.

The schema is filled with the Model's fields (except fields with `hide = true`), and those can be overriden by simply re-declaring them.

This is also useful for adding computed attributes, eg. HTTP links to other resources.

You can think of schemas as the rough equivalent of django-rest-framework's serializers, but it's less boilerplate: relational fields automatically have a nested representation for responses and lookup field values for request bodies.

## Views

Views bind URLs to responses, which are constructed from the schema.

Declare views using the following format:

```
<documentation>
<http method> <path>
	[<param declarations>
	---]
	<code>
```

Where `<documentation>` is a rich-text (markdown inline-level constructs such as *bold* or _italic_ are allowed) description of what this view does, but does _not_ explain path parameters or query parameters, `<http method>` a standard HTTP method and `<code>` some code in python (see <<code-in-views)) which should `return` a `response` object containing an object (dict for python,code in views>> or an array of objects.
The separator (`---`) can have more dashes with a minimum of 3.

As for `<param declarations>` is a newline-separated list of <<url-parameters,url parameter declaration>>

By default, the views are filled with the following:

```py
GET /<resource>/
	List ?sorted
		Sort the response according a comma-separated list of fields
	String ?search
		Searches for matches in <list of searchable fields> fields.
	-----------------------------------------------------------------
	$result = $objects.all()
	for sort_field in $params.sorted:
		if sort_field not in $fields.names:
			raise Http401(f"{sort_field} is not a valid field. Valid fields: {','.join($fields.names)}")
			$result = $result.order_by(sort_field)

	if $params.search:
		for field in $fields.searchable:
			$result = $result.filter(**{f'{field}__like': query_params.search})

GET /<resource>/:lookup
    $result = $objects.get(<lookup field name>=$params.lookup)
```

### Overriding a view while inheriting from the defaults

To redefine a view but still benefit from the defaults or from the `base.rest`:

```ts
>inherit <"defaults" | "base">
<view-declaration>
```

Note that the inherited code will run _before_ the additional code, and the $result will thus be set accordingly.

## Code in views
Django's ORM is used as a backend for interacting with the database. This means that python code included in views will run in a Django environment.

### Error handling
When django raises errors, those can be correlated to certain status codes, which are handled for you:

[%header, cols=2*]
|===
| Exception | Generates
| FieldDoesNotExist | 400 Bad Request
| ObjectDoesNotExist | 404 Not Found
|===

All others uncaught exceptions will generate a `500 Server Error` response.

Of course, you can handle exceptions yourself and raise an `Http<status code>` exception (replace `<status code>` with the status code, eg. 404).

A shortcut syntax (which isn't valid Python but is replaced early) for raising status codes is `respond with <status code> "<error message>"`, which will translate to `raise Http<status code>("<eror message>")`

### Imports
Some modules are automatically imported:

* datetime
* re
* All of the other models (See <<accessing-other-models>>)

### $-Variables

Some variables are automatically created, and are all prefixed by `$`:

$objects ::
    Alias of `<Model>.objects`, with `<Model>` the current resource's model.

$params ::
    Object where each property is a <<url-parameters,url parameter>>.

$result ::
    This variable must be created and will be used to return the response.

$fields.fields ::
    The schema's fields as objects
$fields.names ::
    The schema's fields' names, as a list of strings
$fields.searchable ::
    Shortcut for `[ f for f in $fields.fields if f.searchable ]`

### Accessing other models
Other models are automatically imported if used.
Just use their names as you would do with regular django, eg. `MyOtherModel.objects.all()`


## Field types

The fields (either in the <<models,Model section>> or the <<schemas,Schema section>> are typed, and can be one of the following types:

[%header, cols=3*]
|===
| Type
| Django field equivalent
| Additionnal notes

| UUID
| UUIDField
| Defaults to `uuid.uuid4()` when the property `autogenerate` is true.

| String
| CharField or TextField
| If no `max length` property is set, this is translated into a `TextField`. Else, into a `CharField`.

| Int, Integer
| IntegerField
|

| Float
| FloatField
|

| URL
| URLField
| 

| Binary
| BinaryField
|

| Boolean
| BooleanField
|

| Datetime
| DateTimeField
|

| Date
| DateField
| 

| Time
| TimeField
| 

| Duration
| DurationField
| 

| Email
| EmailField
| 

| File
| FileField
| 

| Filepath
| FilePathField
| 

| IPAddress
| GenericIPAddressField
| 

| Slug
| SlugField
|
|===

## Relational fields

To make a relation to another resouce, use <ResourceName> for the type. (with angle brackets _included_), eg. if you file's name is `my-model-event`, use `<MyModelEvent>`.

Include a `relation` property.
Consider the following file, `my-other-resource.rest`, where this field declaration represents a OneToMany relationship with `my-model-event`. (A MyOtherResouce can have multiple MyModelEvent's)

```
<MyModelEvent> events
	relation = my-other-resource has many events
```

The declaration has the following format:

```
<Other> <field_name>
	relation = <other> has <"one" | "many"> <field_name>
```

Where `<other>` is the referenced resource's kebab-case name, and `<Other>` its PascalCase name.

NOTE: Relational fields must be included in _both_ models, as this makes reading the source code clearer. To do a ManyToMany relationship, use "many" in both models.

## URL Parameters

Parameters come in two forms in URLs: _query parameters_, eg. `http://example.com/my-url?MY_PARAMETER_NAME`, and _path parameters_, eg. `http://example.com/:MY_PARAMETER_NAME`.

In Python functions, _path parameters_ would be _positional arguments_, and _query paramters_ _keyword arguments_.

In RESTLang, those parameters are both defined with a name, a type, a default value and some documentation.

The format is as follows:

```
<type> [?]<name> [= <default value>]
	<documentation>
```

An optional `?` can be put in front of the name to clarify that the parameter is a query parameter, but does not change anything.

Since _path parameters_ are positional, we must include them in the url declaration. These are defined by prepending a word in the path with `:`, following the community-accepted convention used by all REST APIs documentations.

Thus, if declared parameters have no corresponding name in the URL declaration, the parameter is treated as a _query parameter_, *even if the name is prepended with "?"*.

Here's a example:

```
GET /courses/:start/:end
	Date | DateTime start
		The selected date range's lower bound.
	Date | DateTime ?end
		The selected date range's upper bound.
	String[]  week_types = Q1,Q2,BOTH
		Filter events based on their week types. Allowed values: Q1, Q2, BOTH.
	String[] ?include = added,rescheduled
		Decide which types of mutation-affected events to include in the response. Allowed values: added, rescheduled, deleted, offdays.
```

Here, `end` is a _path_ parameter, even though there's a `?` in front. The same goes for `week_types`, which is a _query_ parameter event without a `?`.

The linter will fail with an error if a _query_ parameter as no `?` in front, to prevent typos between the URL and the parameter declaration.

### List type
In URL parameters, types  can be declared like `Type[]`: this means that the parameter accepts a comma-separated list of `Type`pass:[s] (delimiter configurable, see <<Configuring>>)

### Default values
Default values are always strings, its what would have been passed if the parameter was present, not what you'll receive in the code.

### Optional path parameters
Only the _last_ path parameter (in the URL's order) can have a default value.

## Field properties

### Field properties that compile to other django field types

For cleaner code and less types, some django fields are used with  a `type` property, eg. a `File` field with `type = image` will use an `ImageField`.
Field properties' names are not case sensitive.

[%header, cols=3]
|===
| Field type
| Compiles to
| When

.3+| File
.3+| ImageField

| type = image
| mime = image/*
| extension = (an image extension like .png or .jpeg)

| String
| TextField
| max length is not specified

| Integer
| PositiveIntegerField
| postive = true

| Integer
| SmallPositiveInteger
| max ∈ [0, 32767]

| Integer
| SmallInteger
| max ∈ [-32768, 32767]

| Date
| DateTimeField
| include time = true

| Float
| DecimalField
| max digits ≥ 0 *and* decimal places ≤ max digits
|===

### Django properties

Django's field arguments have equivalents as properties.

[%header, cols=2]
|===
| Django |  equivalent property

| blank=True, null=True | optional = true
| choices														 | allowed valuesfootnote:[Use a markdown list of values, indented and on a new line after the "="]
| help_text													| help
| editable=False							| readonly = truefootnote:[Readonly in schemas is not the same: in schemas, POST request will ignore readonly values. Here, it directly translates to django's `editable` (see https://docs.djangoproject.com/fr/3.0/ref/models/fields/#editable).]
.2+| auto_now_addfootnote:[If readonly = false, use default=date.today (for DateFields), datetime.now() (for DateFields) and datetime.now.time() (for TimeFields)]							| default to now
																							| default = now
| auto_now									 | update with now
| height=<h>, width=<w> | size = <w>[ ]<"by", "x", "×">[ ]<h>
|===

These properties can be directly used, with their underscores replaced by spaces:

* default
* null
* blank
* db_column
* db_index
* db_tablespace
* default
* error_messages
* max_length
* allow_unicode
* upload_to
* path
* match
* recursive
* allow_files
* allow_folders
* height
* width
* protocol
* unpack_ipv4

### Validators

Some properties compile to validators:

[%header, cols=2*]
|===
| Property/ies
| Compile(s) to

| matches regex, regex
| RegexValidator

| min, minimum
| MinValueValidator

| max, maximum
| MaxValueValidator

| min length, minimum length
| MinLengthValidator

| max length, maximum length
| MaxLengthValidator

| extension
| FileExtensionValidator

| no null characters
| ProhibitNullCharactersValidator
|===

For custom validators, see <<Custom validation>>

### Unique together

When multiple fields should be unique when considered together, use:

```
unique together with <field name> [, <field name> ...]
```

Where `<field name>` can be a dotted path.
eg.

```
<User> user
	relation = User has many user
Slug name_slug
	unique together with user.id
```

Means that this resource's `name_slug` must be unique with its user's `id` field.


## Custom validation

For custom validation, create a python file `custom_validators.py` or `validators.py`. All functions with their names starting with `validate_` will be usable as validaors for the `validate` property. Inside this property, functions can be referenced without their  `validate_` prefix.

.custom_validators.py
```python
from random import randint
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def validate_lucky(value):
	if randint(1, 666) % 2 == 0:
		raise ValidationError("Try again")
```

.roulette.restapi
```ts
// ...
Integer guess
	validate lucky
// ...
```

## Configuring

Configurations are made in a simple `config.yaml` file.

Here's the default config file:

.config.yaml
```yaml
linkify relational fields: yes
```
